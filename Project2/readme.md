Project 2

In this project, I used the software Cisco Packet Tracer 8.0 to create a network topology connecting two PC's together using Switches with cables and connectors.
To ensure that the network was successfully conected, I used the command prompt to ping each PC, resulting in success.
The green arrows also served as an indicator that everything was running smoothly.

Attached to this folder is the project summary as well as the project itself done in Cisco Packet Tracer.
